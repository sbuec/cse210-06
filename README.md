This project is to create a game similar to the well-known Pong game. 

Participants:
Steven Buechele - sbuec

Eric Woll - SteelHeart96|EricWoll: Player class, NPC class (does not include ai movement), Ball class, Actor class, Paddle class

This game will be a two player game similar to table tennis. Each player has a paddle on their side of the table that they can move around. There is a ball that will bounce back and forth on the screen and each player will try to keep that ball from passing beyond their paddle. When the ball gets past the paddle and reaches the end of the screen the opposite player gains a point.
